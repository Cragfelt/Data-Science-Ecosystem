# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
# 
# 

# In[2]:


# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

x = (3 * 4) + 5
print(x)


# In[8]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

min = int(input("Enter time in minutes: "))
h = min / 60
print("Hours=",h)
